## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a project of the website **[Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one/)**, that is a platform for free courses and bootcamps where you can learn about Web Technologies and they have a gamification system where they can refer you to companies/recruiters and they can see your score on the website. **[Gabriela Pinheiro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgMbExqiFFPza79dyMsuugw)** is a volunteer instructor and Front-End Developer who, with the help of Digital Innovation One, published this project which is a copy of the Instagram login page using FlexBox, where I made some modifications and added other parts as a login page, logged in and of registration. Hope you like.

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce the **Instagram login page** as close as possible to the original design.

In this challenge my biggest difficulty was to implement the smooth scrolling of the page with pure JavaScript, in no way I was able to make it work, with that I had to use the Jquery library and only with it I was able to make the scrolling work the way I wanted.The email validation I was able to do only with pure JavaScript.
